## About The Project
WildcatMatch is spin off of the age old Memory Card Matcthing game.    The first player turns over 2 cards. If the pictures match, the cards and are removed from the board tries again for another match. If the cards do not match, the cards are turned back overover and thier turn is over.  Each time a player successfully matches 2 cards they can add a point to the scoreboard by clcking the +1 button. At the end of the game whichever player has the highest score wins.  

The functions that run drive the program are very simple and I created them with niece and nephew who expressed an interests in programing.  All the ingredients to bake the cake are included and it woks with on any webbrowser as well as phones, or tablets.
